B: Mucho-Mucho Zenshin Taimo
2 devil fruit 1 random, 4 cooldown
Largo traps an opponent inside himself. One enemy will be stunned
for 5 turns or until Largo dies. If that enemy receives 
nonaffliction damage during this time, Largo will be dealt damage
equal to 50% of the received damage rounded down. This skill 
cannot be interrupted by stuns, but will end if the targeted 
enemy becomes invulnerable.
(Meaning, if the trapped enemy takes 25 damage from Luffy's Gomu Gomu no 
Pistol, then they will be dealt 25 damage and Largo will lose
12 health. The damage he receives ignores invulnerability)
