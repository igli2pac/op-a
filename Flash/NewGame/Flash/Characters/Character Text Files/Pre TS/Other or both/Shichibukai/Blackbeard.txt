C1: Devil Fruit Steal
1 random, no cooldown
Blackbeard steals the ability of a devil fruit user.

any devil fruit skills, Blackbeard will permanently exchange this 
ability with a random one of that enemies devil fruit abilities.
This skill ends on all other enemies when triggered.
(For example, if this skill was used on Ivankov he will randomly
copy either "Emporio Ganmen Seicho Hormone", "Emporio Tension 
Hormone" or "Emporio Onna Hormone" since "DEATH WINK is not a 
devil fruit ability. This skill will have no effect on characters 
with no devil fruit powers like Wanze or Usopp)
